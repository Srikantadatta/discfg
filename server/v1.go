	//
	// OR. Make another route and handler for adjusting configuration settings using PUT.
	// https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec9.html ...says OPTIONS can contain
	// some data in the body request, though defines no use for it. So it's up in the air.
	//
	// It might then also be neat to hav an OPTIONS for other routes.
	// These responses would all be handled here and be just for self-documenting the API.
	// OPTIONS request on a key path for example would return information about how to
	// update or delete that specific key. On /v1/:name/key it might then just be
	// instructions for creating a key.
	//
	// Need to think this over. Sleep on it.
	// YES. All of it. OPTIONS all the things!
	//
	// There will only be so many options that can be changed after creation.
	// For example, if we wanted to gzip the data ... That couldn't be turned on/off after creation.
	// Doing so would mean all existing values would need to change.
	// Though for gzip, I think it might be a nice additional value on the record that specifies the data is gzipped.
	// So it can be done on a key by key basis. So if it was sent gzipped, then when it is read there'll be a simple
	// if/then that unzips. So users can decide how the data is stored. ... Think about that too. I'm not sure they
	// should care or have to say on each key. It likely should just be done always. Or on a per configuration basis.
	// So again, that kinda stuff must be set up front upon creation and can not change.
	//
	// So the options being set here are going to be quite limited.
	// Though I don't want to handle them all here... EAch adapter should.
	//
	// So take a map of options. map[string]interface{}
	// Then pass that to each storage adapter. Then each adapter can figure out and choose which things to use/set.
	// Which means the gzip setting, and any other setting that can't be changed after creation, is simply ignored
	// at that point even if passed.
	//
	//
	// SO. If there's been a body passed, parsed JSON, call commands.UpdateCfg()
	// Then still return this. I believe. And Hope. That it will immediately see the change
	// and then in the `CfgState` say something like "PENDING" ... Then the user knows their change
	// is being made. Check OPTIONS again (without passing data) to see when change has been made.
	// An HTTP OPTIONS request does not cache and in this case we really don't want it to.
